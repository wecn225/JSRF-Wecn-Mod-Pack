# JSRF Wecn Mod Pack

![Look at cover.png](./cover.png)

This is the wecn modpak for Jet Set Radio Future. A modded xbox or emulator is required for using this modpack

This respiratory contains two folders: Media and Source. The Media folder contains all of the modified JSRF files in the correct folder structure, and the Source folder contains all of the original graphics files, etc used to make them. Unfortunately, much of the modpack is old and the original working files no longer exist.

To install the mod, copy all of the folders within this respiratory's Media folder into the vanilla JSRF Media folder. If playing on a modded xbox, the vanilla versions of all of the modified files must be deleted from the xbox's cache (just deleting the whole "Media" folder from the xbox's cache will also work)
